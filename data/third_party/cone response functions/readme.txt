Cone sensitivity functions are from http://cvrl.ucl.ac.uk/cones.htm for a 2-degree and 10-degree observer and assuming photopic vision. The sensitivities are linear in energy, and are in 1nm steps. The funcions have each been normalized to unity. See CVRL for more information about the sensitivity functions.
