This directory contains Python code used for examples on loomsci.wordpress.com.
The codes use the repo's default license unless otherwise noted in the files or
subdirectories themselves.

Some examples may require additional modules to be installed. It is assumed that
the reader has the appropriate skills to locate and install the module for their
particular Python setup. Notes are generally included in the code examples about
where to source the modules. Specifically, notes of the form
  "apt-get install some-package-name"
refer to Ubuntu's package manager and its naming scheme for the packages which
contain the module.
