Style Guide
===============
When contributing code, please try to keep to the following style:
- Lines of 80 characters or less; use the '...' continuation to wrap lines if needed
- Functions must include a description (though the descriptions don't need to conform to Matlab's docstring formatting for this repo)
- If a function implements an idea from another source (a blog, a paper, etc), include the source's bibliographic information.
- Please note changes on the change log inside each file. The format is the date as YYYY/MM/DD, a message about the changes made, then author information (such as e-mail). For example:
   % Change log:
   %  2015/08/22 -- original file created; nloomis@gmail.com
   %  2015/09/19 -- style information added; nloomis@
   %
- Please include some notes to help explain what each part of a function does, or if a particularly interesting operation is being done.
